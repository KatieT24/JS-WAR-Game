<!--to me messing up some code in the terminal, it took me some time to fix and figure out how
to get my code pushed to the repository. turned out because the json file got locked and crashed, it was keeping my code
from going through and not being added to the repository. After deleting the locked file, i was able to go
thrugh a cheat sheet that my mentor gave me to correctly push code through. I can finally finish up this project and sent it on it's way. -->
